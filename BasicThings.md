#Creating your bot
What we will work on right? so, go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) Click on the New Application and put the bot name you wanted to!

1) Congrats! your bot has been created! now we will get Token of the bot. Remember never share the token with anyone. It can easily destroy your bot! To get your token go to Bot section. Then press "Reset Token" then copy the token!
2) Now, you need to invite the bot to your server. for that click OAuth2 section. You will see 2 option a)General b)URL Generator. You need to click the URL Generator. There you will find **SCOPES**. There you need to select 
"bot" and "applications.commands then you will see **BOT PERMISSIONS** Just select **`Administrator`** for now. You will see a link just copy it and paste it on your browser.
3) You will need a host to host your bot. I would recommand (for newbie) to use replit or else you can use free host.
4) Let's start coding!
